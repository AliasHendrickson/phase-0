**What does puts do?**
  Puts returns nil and prints the output of the Ruby program to the console with a new line.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**
    An integer is a number without a decimal point, and a float is a number with a decimal point.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
  Integer division derives integer answers, and the same concept is true of float division. Float division is more precise because it uses decimal points. With integer division, the computer will round down instead of giving an exact answer.

puts 24*365

puts (24*60)*3650

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**
  It handles them according to the regular order of operations. However, it outputs integer answers for integer operations and float answers for float operations.

**What is the difference between integers and floats?**
  Integers are whole numbers with no decimal point, and floats are numbers with a decimal point.

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**
  Integer division will give an answer that is rounded down. Float division will return an answer with a decimal point.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**
  A string is a group of characters between quotation marks. They are commonly used when writing words in the code. For example, assigning my name to a variable would use an operation like this my_name = "Alec"

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**
  Local variables are objects that have been assigned a specific value. This value could be a number, a string, another variable, etc. Variables can be used when we want to hold on to the value of an object, or if we want to act on the object in multiple different ways.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**
  This challenge was really easy. I struggled a lot during my pre-interview prep work, so the basics are still fresh in my head. I am excited to start using Ruby again!
