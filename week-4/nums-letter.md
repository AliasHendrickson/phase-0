**What is an integer? What is a float?**
    An integer is a number without a decimal point, and a float is a number with a decimal point.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
  Integer division derives integer answers, and the same concept is true of float division. Float division is more precise because it uses decimal points. With integer division, the computer will round down instead of giving an exact answer.

puts 24*365

puts (24*60)*3650
