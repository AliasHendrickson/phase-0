#H1 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

**Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?**

I learned about setting alarms for _focus time_ and the importance of taking breaks. I learned that meditation can increase my capacity for focused effort. I read about starting small and practicing regularly to establish a behavior that will increase my confidence and show me that I can grow and change with any ability or skill. With that, I learned that my attitude does not have to come first. Interestingly, I learned that I may not be an output machine like I have so often thought. Along with taking breaks, I learned that keeping my production interesting and fresh helps productivity because it engages my mind and does away with the mundane.

**Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?**

I will work on meditation and the pomodoro technique of setting timers for _focus time_ and taking breaks. I will start small with 5 minutes of meditation every morning. As I become more comfortable with sitting still, I may decide to increase the time or amount of sessions. I can incorporate meditation into my pomodoro practice by using my break time as meditation time. I have a tendency to look at the clock when I’m working. To prevent this and improve my focus, I will remove the visual clocks from my devices and set my alarm to awaken me from my trance. Before entering the zone, I will make clear to myself what I want to accomplish, and lay out the necessary materials I need to succeed.

**What is _Time Boxing?_ How can you use it in Phase 0?**

_Time Boxing_ is a technique that calls for setting aside a certain amount of time to work towards a goal and stopping the work once the assigned time is up. Then once the time is up, you reflect on your work. I can use this technique in Phase 0 to tackle my solo challenges in boxes of time rather than trying to solve it all at once. I can also use Time Boxing for pair programming sessions. This might help us focus on the details of the work rather than the big goal.

**How do you manage your time currently?**

Currently I manage my time by writing my fixed activities in a planner, and then assigning blocks of time for other things that I want to do or need to do. In this way, I wake up knowing what I need/want to work on and when, and all that’s left is for me to execute.

**Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?**

It is working for me because I have plenty of time in between due dates to complete my work. Historically, i do not have problems with punctuality and deadlines. However, with this extra workload, I will be working to improve my focus and productivity in order to get more done in less time.

**What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?**

My overall plan is to work for 3 - 5 hours per day, and take 5 minute meditation breaks on the hour. After my sessions, I plan to reflect on what I’ve learned or accomplished by speaking with one of my fellow boots or one of my friends in the programming world.

##H2 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

**What is a shell? What is _bash_?**

A shell is a program that allows the user to interface with the operating system via text commands. _Bash_ is a shell program that runs on most Linux systems.

**What was the most challenging for you in going athrough this material?**

I found it difficult to conceptualize what the commands were doing as I was typing them. It was a challenge for me to undo my mistakes by moving forward with new commands rather than _deleting_ my previous commands.

**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

I was able to execute most of the commands without much issue. The _copy_ command gave me the most trouble. I was trying to copy a file that did not exist in the directory tree that I was working under. Eventually I worked my way around the directory trees and brought my file to the right space. This required the use of several different commands, so I got some practice using them on the fly.

**In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**

I think the _man_ command will be the most helpful as a beginner. Listing the directories with the _ls_ command proved extremely useful for running checks to make sure I had done the right thing. Since the shell does not print when something goes right, it is nice to have that reassurance to avoid floundering in the dark. Understanding how the arguments for _cp_, _mvdir_, and _rmdir_ are executed is important, too. To me, it seems that it will be all too easy to get tangled in the branches of the directory trees if I am not 100% about where I am moving things to and from.

**Write what each does:**

pwd - print working directory

ls - list directories

mv - move

cd - change directory

../ - is the “Users” directory

touch - creates an empty file

mkdir - make directory

less - page through a file

rmdir - remove directory

rm - remove files or directories

help - prints a list of commands
