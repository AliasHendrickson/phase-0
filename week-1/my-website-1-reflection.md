**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**
  Next to your avatar in the top right hand corner on GitHub, click the _+_ symbol and select _new repository_.Add a name for your repository, and select a license that suits your needs. If you do not know your needs, click the _i_ icon and read what they have suggested, and/or ask Google. Finish up by selecting _create repository_. To clone your new repository, first navigate to the repository page by clicking the name of your repository. Then, find the box that says *HTTPS*. Next to the box will be a link that reads something like _https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git_, where *USERNAME* is substituted with your username. Copy this link and open up the Terminal application (for Mac users) or the command prompt (for Windows users). Make sure you are in the directory where you want your clone to be saved. You can check this by typing _pwd_ to *print working directory* and see which directory you are cudrrently operating in, and use the _cd <DIRECTORY NAME>_ command to change to the directory you would like the clone to be put into. Lastly, type _git clone <URL>_ and substitute the repository URL into the command, and hit enter. Congratulations, your clone has been created.

**Describe what open source means.**
  Open source means that the source code for a project is open for any and all users to make edits, and commit those edits for further review and merging.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**
  I think Open Source is a beautiful way to collaborate with countless people. It takes the pressure off me because I feel like I can add my knowledge to the flow and learn all that I need to know from the existing users and their code. Open Source feels like the best possible way for so many people to come together and create.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**
  To me, licenses set or remove the restrictions of what other users can do with my source code. If I want something open for everyone to use and make edits to, there is a license for that. If I want to keep my source code in a tighter circle of users, there is a license for that as well. In a way, licenses are like patents for designs, or trademarks for brand slogans. Licenses protect your intellectual property so that you may claim ownership of your work, and keep people from unduly profiting from your labors of love.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**
  I have a tighter understanding of pushing, pulling, and merging branches now, and I know the more I practice the easier it will become. I had to look up the commands just to make sure. I spent the better part of 3 hours running myself in Terminal circles in the previous challenge because I did not run checks on my commands when I should have. This time, I slowed down and made sure every step I made was doing what I wanted, and it worked well.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
  I'm sure this is not new, but I have found stackoverflow.com immensely helpful.
  Also, when I google concepts to search for resources I often end up in GitHub repositories with loads of helpful information.
