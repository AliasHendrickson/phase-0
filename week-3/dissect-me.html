<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  I come back to the <section> tag, the <main> tag and the <nav> tag because they are familiar to me. I like chopping up the content of the body in an HTML doc using the section tags.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  Elements are laid out on a page like a skeleton. There's the mind which contains the meta data like the character set and styling, and there are the bones which hold the body content and other content like footers, headings, and navigation. The browser displays elements according to their alignment in HTML.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  I learned that there are autofill shortcuts that I can create to make repetitive coding quicker. I'm sure I will use more of them later. Researching would be a good way to see what other people are using them for.
