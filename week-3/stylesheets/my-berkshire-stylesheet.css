/* **What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?**
    It is important to know the path from the HTML file to the external file you are linking. If the path is not right then the linked file will have no effect.

**What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?**
    I used margin and float to move images around. It was tough to get the site to look right. I still have a little ways to go.

**What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)**
    I used font-family, font-size, color and not much else.

**Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?**
    I used a class for the unordered list to separate it into two columns. Looking back, I don't think I needed to do that. I found that the '-webkit-column' worked with the class, but I didn't try it on just the unordered list element.

**When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?**
    I think our code is still a little rough, but the source code for the berkshire site seems out of date, excessive and messy. It's hard to read because the elements aren't nested well, and there is a lot of styling in the HTML that can be avoided.
