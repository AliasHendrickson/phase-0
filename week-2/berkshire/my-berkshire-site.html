- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was satisfying to put the tools into action and see real-time results with something that I created. Having to research on the fly really solidified that there are many different ways to solve the same problem, even in HTML.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  Researching HTML5 was no different for me than researching another language. I searched for what I was trying to get done, and used the documentation and examples that I found to put together my code.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I did not feel the urge to add anything more than structure because I was focused on the task at hand. I am a visual person, and really enjoy putting style to things, but I dulled my desire to make this webpage beautiful in favor of making my code extensible.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    HTML is like layers of a cake, and CSS is like the icing and the filling. Structure is very important, and HTML excels at it, but it seems limited to it as well. HTML needs CSS.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I remember HTML visually, and sequentially. The language for the tags makes this very easy. It starts at the top with headers, body, and footer. Then, the <h1> and subsequent tags are in order of importance. I remember it like I'm writing an outline for an essay.
