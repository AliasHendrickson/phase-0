**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**
  The 6 phases are:
    1. *Information Gathering*
        A web designer needs to know about their clients goals and target audience in order to deliver content in a manner that is relevant to the end users.
    2. *Planning*
        Build a site map that captures the topics and sub-topics of the content that will be displayed on the site. Designers will ask about content management systems at this stage as well.
    3. *Design*
        The look and feel of the site should be tailored to the target audience. For example, user experience varies based on age group. Designers will create prototypes to send to their clients for review.
    4. *Development*
        Creation of the functional web site. First comes the home page, and then a "shell" as a template to be distributed to the other content pages. Open communication between designer and client to ensure the fulfillment of end goals.
    5. *Testing and Delivery*
        Final detailing and ensuring complete functionality on multiple platforms and browsers. Plugin installation and SEO are implemented at this stage.
    6. *Maintenance*
        Keep users coming back by continually updating products and content. Content Management Systems allow you to update your own information without the designers input.

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**
  I want my site to be a place where I can build my portfolio, and have a homebase for my online presence. It will feature links to all my social networks, a gallery of my work, and access to my blog. I plan to add branded products as well, and supplementary content that I can link to and build credibility through networking.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**
  My target audience is interested in stellar visuals, organic self-progression, connection with self/soul/people, and games! I see my site being aesthetically pleasing with a welcoming vibe that exudes pure happiness. My blog will be full of positivity. There will be a creative, near whimsical energy to keep people engaged and to promote playfulness.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**
  I want people to view my portfolio and find information about how to work with me. I want to entice people with links to different sites and pique interest in other related material. I want to keep people engaged and active.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
  Design and user experience should be tailored to reach as wide an audience as possible within the target range. Design should always have the end user in mind.
**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**
  User experience is how the user interacts and feels about the system they are using. It is valuable because so many people are on the web for so many reasons. If a website does not offer a smooth and enjoyable experience, it is likely to damage their brand image and online presence.
**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
  Answering the questions about user experience after I just read the articles.
