<!-- Reflection

  What did you learn about the DOM?
    I learned that it is tough to keep straight what the methods are working with.
     i.e. Attributes, elements, etc. I also found that some of the methods return arrays, and we can work with certain elements by indexing them.

  What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
    getElementBy____ is great for grabbing certain elements grouped by ID, or tag, or ClassName. I bet the cloneNode method is useful as well when there are a few nodes that need to be repeated.
